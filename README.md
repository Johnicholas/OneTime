OneTime is an open source encryption program that uses the one-time pad method.

See [red-bean.com/onetime](http://www.red-bean.com/onetime/) for more
information.  You can also run `./onetime;&nbsp;--intro` for an
introduction, or `./onetime;&nbsp;--help` for complete usage.

OneTime is written in Python, and requires Python 2.6 or higher (but
it has not been ported to Python 3 yet&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;there's an
[open issue](https://github.com/kfogel/OneTime/issues/15) for that and
patches are very welcome).

Please use the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/kfogel/OneTime)
for filing issues or submitting pull requests.  OneTime's [source
code](https://github.com/kfogel/OneTime/blob/master/onetime) is
heavily commented; any question you might have about design or
implementation is probably answered there.  If you're writing a patch
or a pull request for OneTime, be sure to include a new regression
test in
[check.sh](https://github.com/kfogel/OneTime/blob/master/check.sh).
