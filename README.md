OneTime is an open source encryption program that uses the one-time pad method.

See [red-bean.com/onetime](http://www.red-bean.com/onetime/) for more
information.  You can also run `./onetime --intro` for an
introduction, or `./onetime --help` for complete usage.

OneTime is written in Python, and requires Python 2.6 or higher (but
it has not been ported to Python 3 yet&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;there's an <a
href="https://github.com/kfogel/OneTime/issues/15" >open issue</a> for
that and patches are very welcome).

Please use the <a href="https://github.com/kfogel/OneTime" >GitHub
repository</a> for filing issues or submitting pull requests.
OneTime's <a href="https://github.com/kfogel/OneTime/blob/master/onetime" 
>source code</a> is heavily commented; any question you might have
about design or implementation is probably answered there.  If you're
