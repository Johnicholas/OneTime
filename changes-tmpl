<h3 style="text-decoration: underline;" >Changes in 2.0</h3>

<ul style="list-style-type: circle; ">
<li><p>Pad IDs have changed, because they are calculated differently
    now.  The IDs in your <tt>pad-records</tt> file will be upgraded
    automatically; you do not need to do anything.</p>

    <p><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;" >Important
    note to 2.x beta testers</span>: Pad IDs changed
    <span style="text-decoration: underline;" >during</span> the
    development process for 2.0 too, so if you used interim 2.0 beta
    versions, then you will probably need to fix your
    ~/.onetime/pad-records file&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;otherwise there is a
    danger of pad range reuse!  For each of your pad files, run the
    command "<tt>onetime&nbsp;-p&nbsp;PAD_FILE&nbsp;--show-id</tt>"
    with your older 2.0-beta version of onetime, save the outputs, and
    then upgrade onetime to 2.0-beta10 or later and run the same
    command for each pad.  Use the two output sets to manually update
    the pad IDs in your ~/.onetime/pad-records file.</p></li>
<li><p>Message authentication and integrity checking, based on an
    embedded SHA-256 digest in the ciphertext and on the message's
    position within the ciphertext being based on surrounding pad data.
    This combination protects against the situation where someone who can
    interfere with the transmission channel would have both a possible
    bit-flipping attack on message integrity and a known-plaintext
    message-substitution attack.  (Thanks to Andy Isaacson for
    pointing out these problems in a
    <a href="https://mailman.stanford.edu/pipermail/liberationtech/2013-July/010405.html"
    >discussion</a> on the Liberation Tech mailing list.)</p></li> 
<li><p>New output format (<a href="example.onetime" >example</a>), to
    support the above new features and for more efficient pad usage.
    OneTime 2.x can still read 1.x output, but 1.x and older versions
    cannot read 2.x output.</p></li>
<li><p>New <tt>--show-id</tt> option displays a pad's ID.</p></li>
<li><p>New <tt>--pad-help</tt> option tells how to generate pads.</p></li>
<li><p>There is no more automated version control of pad metadata.
    This is for many
    <a href="https://github.com/kfogel/OneTime/commit/e343a860123a01c6ddb3f7ce2537325efe17238f
    " >reasons</a>, among them code simplicity and the
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_astonishment"
    >Principle of Least Astonishment</a>.  You can still keep your
    <tt>~/.onetime/</tt> area under VC manually, of course.</p></li>
<li><p>The <tt>--no-vc</tt> option is therefore removed.</p></li>
<li><p>OneTime's license is now an <a href="LICENSE" >MIT-style free
    software / open source license</a>, to avoid various
    <a href="http://opensource.org/faq#public-domain" >problems</a>
    with the public domain in certain jurisdictions.</p></li>
<li><p>New <tt>--license</tt> option displays the license.</p></li>
<li><p>A bug with with saving the pad-records file on Microsoft
    Windows <a href="https://github.com/kfogel/OneTime/issues/13" 
    >is now fixed</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>You can now do
    <tt>make&nbsp;install&nbsp;--prefix=SOME_INSTALLATION_PREFIX</tt>.
    (Thanks to <a href="https://github.com/kfogel/OneTime/pull/12" 
    >@DomT4</a>.)</p></li>
<li><p>For developers: <a href="check.sh" >regression test suite</a>
    added.</p></li>

<h3 style="text-decoration: underline;" >Compatibility between OneTime 1.x and 2.x</h3>

<ul style="list-style-type: circle;">

<li><p>Messages encrypted with OneTime 1.x will always be decryptable
by 2.x and higher versions.</p></li>

<li><p>Message encrypted with 2.x are <em>not</em> decryptable by 1.x
versions.</p></li>

<li><p>The latest testing version on the 2.x line
is <a href="onetime-2XVERSION" >2XVERSION</a>, released
2016-06-14.</p></li>

<li><p><span style="font-style: italic; color: red;">There have been
incompatible format changes along the 2.x line during the course of
2.x development and beta testing.</span> If you're having trouble
decrypting a message encrypted with one of the previous beta versions,
just backdate along the 2.x line until you find a version that can
decrypt that message (but please don't use those old versions to
encrypt anything new).</p></li>
