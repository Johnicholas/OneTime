    <p style="text-decoration: underline;">Pad data must be truly random:</p>

    <p>Note that the one-time pad method depends completely on the
    quality of the pad data: if the pad is not truly random, the
    security of your messages cannot be guaranteed.  So to use OneTime
    reliably, you need a source of good random data to create pad
    files.  On modern Linux systems, the <tt>/dev/random</tt> device
    is probably good enough (I haven't done the math
    myself&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;I'm just taking other people's <a
    href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki//dev/random#Linux" >word</a>
    for it).  Elsewhere, you're on your own.</p>

  <div class="four column">
    <p style="text-decoration: underline;">Never re-use pad data:</p>

    <p>If the same pad data is used to encrypt different
    messages&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;no matter how similar or different
    those messages are&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;then the security of the
    system can be greatly compromised.  Never encrypt different
    messages with the same stretch of pad!  Doing so could reveal some
    or all of the used pad to eavesdroppers.  OneTime's default
    behavior is to always avoid reusing pad data, unless you tell it
    otherwise.</p>

  <div class="four column">
    <p style="text-decoration: underline;">Recommended practice:</p>

    <p>If you are Alice communicating with Bob, then keep two
    different pads, <tt>alice_to_bob.pad</tt> and
    <tt>bob_to_alice.pad</tt>, as opposed to sharing the same pad for
    both directions of communication.  With two separate pads, even if
    you each send a message simultaneously to the other with no
    advance planning, you still won't accidentally use any of the same
    pad data twice, assuming you let OneTime do its bookkeeping
    naturally.</p>

<h2>Who uses OneTime, and why?</h2>

<p>I don't know&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;I just get enough bug reports and
feature requests to know that there are people using this.  Some are
anonymous, some are not.</p>

<p>One-time pad systems are inconvenient, because of the difficulty of
pad generation and exchange.  There are many easier cryptography
systems out there.  If you don't have a reason to use OneTime, then
don't.  Its existence does not imply a rejection of other
cryptosystems; in fact, I normally use <a
href="http://www.red-bean.com/kfogel/public-key.html" >GPG</a> myself.
OneTime might be handy in a few rare situations:</p>

<ul style="padding-left: 3%; list-style-type: circle; ">
<li><p>You're not completely confident about the provenance of <a
    href="http://www.gnupg.org/" >GnuPG</a>, or underlying system
    libraries, on your computer.</p></li>
<li><p>To bootstrap trust: i.e., to have a reliable fallback method for
    exchanging other, more convenient keys.</p></li>
<li><p>To have an encryption program whose code is small and simple
    enough that you can inspect and understand it.</p></li>
<li><p>To throw a little diversity into the surveillance stream.
    Bots are watching for &amp; saving messages in the popular
    encryption formats.  OneTime makes 'em work a little harder! :-)</p> </li>
