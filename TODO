ToDo list for OneTime.  (We should probably get a real bug tracker.)

* There seem to be two styles of 'raise' call in the code.  Consistify.

* Likewise with "\\\n(" vs "(\n" in function calls.  Latter is preferred.

* Failed decryption should create no output file, not create 0-byte file.

* Look at environment variables as well as options, for things like
  config location, etc.

* Make pad-records file location potentially independent of config dir.

* Yo.  Wrap those base64 lines with newlines.  Hmm, they *are* wrapped
  in v1 output; why is v2 different?  Apparently because of r145, when
  base64.encodestring() was replaced with base64.b64encode(), for
  reasons not clear in the comments or log message.  Make sure that
  undoing that is okay before undoing.

* Put a 'version' file in ~/.onetime, so that future versions of
  onetime can notice what the previously-installed version was (absent
  means 1, of course) and make the appropriate recommendations.
