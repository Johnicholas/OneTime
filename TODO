ToDo list for OneTime.  (We should probably get a real bug tracker.)

* "onetime -d -p PAD INPUT -o OUTPUT" should work

  Putting input argument before last option should work.  Why doesn't it?

* Off-by-one-error when when adding the next encrypted length each time?

  Try encrypting long-msg multiple times, watch the used range climb
  by "length(long-msg) - 1" each time.

  Preliminary investigation indicates there's no bug here.  Confirm.

* Failed decryption should create no output file, not create 0-byte file.

* Put a 'version' file in ~/.onetime, so that future versions of
  onetime can notice what the previously-installed version was (absent
  means 1, of course) and make the appropriate recommendations.
