ToDo list for OneTime.  (We should probably get a real bug tracker.)

* Failed decryption should create no output file, not create 0-byte file.

* Look at environment variables as well as options, for things like
  config location, etc.

* Make pad-records file location potentially independent of config dir.

* Put a 'version' file in ~/.onetime, so that future versions of
  onetime can notice what the previously-installed version was (absent
  means 1, of course) and make the appropriate recommendations.
