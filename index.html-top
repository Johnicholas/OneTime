<li><p>New output format.<br/>

    now.  The IDs in your <tt>pad-records</tt> file will be upgraded
    automatically; you do not need to do anything.</p></li>
<li><p>New <tt>--show-id</tt> option displays a pad's ID.</p></li>
<li><p>The config file <tt>~/.onetime/config</tt> is looked for, and

<li><p>Version control (VC) of pad metadata is off by default (by the

<li><p>VC can be turned on in the config file, or on a per-command

<li><p>Regression <a href="check.sh" >test suite</a> added.</p></li>

<p><a href="onetime">OneTime</a> is an <a href="LICENSE" >open
source</a> encryption program that uses
the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-time_pad">one-time
pad</a> algorithm to allow two parties to communicate securely,
without worrying about
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NSA_electronic_surveillance_program"
>unauthorized people listening in</a>.  OneTime has features to assist
with the bureaucracy of pad management and comes with built-in help.
It is written in the <a href="http://www.python.org/" >Python</a>
programming language and requires a Python interpreter to run.</p>

<p>In Debian GNU/Linux or Ubuntu, you can just use the package manager
to install the "<a href="http://packages.debian.org/sid/onetime"
>onetime</a>" package.  (But as of July 2013, the version of OneTime
packaged in Debian and Ubuntu is a major version number behind this
upstream release; we'll try to get the distros updated soon.)</p>

<p>Note that the one-time pad method depends completely on the quality
of the pad data: if the pad is not truly random, the security of your
messages cannot be guaranteed.  So to use OneTime reliably, you need a
source of good random data to create pad files.  On modern Linux
systems, the <tt>/dev/random</tt> device is probably good enough (I
haven't done the math myself, I'm just taking other people's
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki//dev/random#Linux" >word</a> for
it); elsewhere, you're on your own.</p>

<p>Also, if the same pad data is used to encrypt different plaintext
messages&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;even slightly different ones, such as the
same plaintext but shifted a bit&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;then the security
of the system is greatly compromised.  Never encrypt with the same
stretch of pad twice!  Doing so could reveal some or all of the used
pad to eavesdroppers.  OneTime's default behavior is to always avoid
reusing pad data, unless you tell it otherwise.</p>
