<p><a href="otp">OTP</a> is an encryption program that
uses the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-time_pad">one-time  
pad</a> algorithm to allow two parties to communicate securely,
without worrying about
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domestic_spying_program">unauthorized
people listening in</a>.  OTP compresses plaintext input to save pad,
has features that assist with the bureaucracy of pad management, and
comes with built-in help.  It is written in the
<a href="http://www.python.org/">Python</a> programming language; you
must have a Python interpreter installed to run OTP.</p>
