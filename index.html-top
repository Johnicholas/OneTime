<p><a href="onetime">OneTime</a> is a public
domain, <a href="http://www.opensource.org/" >open source</a>
encryption program that uses the <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-time_pad">one-time pad
algorithm</a> to allow two parties to communicate securely, without
worrying about <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NSA_electronic_surveillance_program"
>unauthorized people listening in</a>.  OneTime has features that
assist with the bureaucracy of pad management, and comes with built-in
help.  It is written in the <a href="http://www.python.org/"
>Python</a> programming language and requires a Python interpreter to
run.</p>

<p>In Debian GNU/Linux or Ubuntu, you can just use the package manager
to install the "<a href="http://packages.debian.org/sid/onetime"
>onetime</a>" package.</p>

<p>To use OneTime reliably, you need a source of good random data.  On
modern Unix systems, the <tt>/dev/random</tt> device is probably good
enough (I haven't done the math myself, I'm just taking other people's
word for it).  On non-Unix systems, you're on your own.  Whatever your
source of random data, store the data in a file (that's the "pad") and
point to it using OneTime's <tt>-p</tt> option when you encrypt; the
recipient must use the same pad to decrypt, of course.  Note that the
one-time pad method depends completely on the quality of the pad data;
if the pad is not truly random, the security of your messages cannot
be guaranteed.  Never encrypt different plaintexts with the same
stretch of pad&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;doing so could reveal some or all of
the used pad to eavesdroppers.  OneTime's default behavior is to always
avoid reusing pad data, unless you tell it otherwise.</p>
