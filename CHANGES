2.x:

  - No more compression.
  - New '~/.onetime/config' file looked for, and created if not present.
  - VC is off by default instead of on.
  - New --use-vc option.
  - Old --no-vc option still works (to override the config option).
  - Introduction of "Format:" header.
  - 1.x cannot read 2.x output, but 2.x can read 1.x.
  - (Don't forget to list bugfixes too.)
