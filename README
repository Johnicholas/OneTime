OneTime is an encoder/decoder for one-time pads.  Run './onetime --intro'
for an introduction, or './onetime --help' for usage.

See http://www.red-bean.com/onetime/ for more information.

(Note: development is currently aimed at releasing version 2.0, which
will fix some issues with the 1.x series.  While the 2.x line will be
backwards-compatible with 1.x, development of 2.x is done on a branch
so that the necessary compatibility shims can all be completed safely.
See http://svn.red-bean.com/repos/onetime/branches/2.x/ for more.)
