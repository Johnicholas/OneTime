<p>You might not need to use this.  One-time pad systems are
inconvenient, because of the difficulty of pad generation and
exchange.  There are many easier cryptography systems out there.  If
you don't have a reason to use this, then don't.</p>

<p>OneTime could be handy in a few rare situations:</p>

<ul style="padding-left: 3%; list-style-type: circle; ">
<li><p>You're not completely confident about the provenance of <a href="http://www.gnupg.org/" >GnuPG</a> on your system.</p></li>
<li><p>To bootstrap trust: i.e., to have a reliable fallback method for
  exchanging other, more convenient keys.</p></li>
<li><p>To have an encryption program whose code is small and simple
  enough that you can inspect it and understand it.</p></li>
<li><p>To throw a little diversity into the surveillance stream.
  Bots are watching for &amp; saving messages in the popular
  encryption formats.  OneTime makes 'em work a little harder! :-)</p> </li>
</ul>

<p>I'm not really sure who's using this program nor why they're using
it.  I get enough bug reports and feature requests to be confident
that there is a user base, though, so I continue to maintain it.</p>
