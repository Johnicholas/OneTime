Description: command-line encryption using the "one-time pad" method
 OneTime is an encoder/decoder that uses the one-time pad algorithm.
 .
 OneTime is a simple encryption program that takes care of some of
 the pad-management bureaucracy for you. It avoids re-using pad
 data (except when decrypting the same encrypted message twice, of
 course) by maintaining records of pad usage.
 .
 If you keep your ~/.onetime configuration area under version control
 with Subversion or CVS, OneTime will automatically update it to get the
 latest pad usage records before using a pad, and will commit new
 records after using a pad.  Thus, by sharing a single configuration
 area via version control, you and your interlocutors can transparently
 avoid the sin of pad range reuse.
 .
 See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-time_pad for more information
 about one-time pads in general; run 'onetime --help' for a detailed
 usage message about OneTime itself.
